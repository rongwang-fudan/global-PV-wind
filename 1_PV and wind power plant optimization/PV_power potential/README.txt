1. Please run '1_powerunit_PV_county2' first and then '2_powerunit_pv_all_county' to optimize the type and spatial distribution of PV power plants with maximal area in each county of each country. 

2. Then please run '3_transmission' to calculate the distance from each power plant to corresponding subatation and UHV line.

3. Then please run '4_num_plant' to calculate the cost of each power plant with gradually increasing size.

4. Then please run '5_powercosts' to make sure location and size of each PV power plants with minimal LCOE.
