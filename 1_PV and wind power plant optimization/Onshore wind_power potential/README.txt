1. Please run '1_powerunits' first to optimize the type and spatial distribution of onshorewind power plants with maximal area in each county. 

2. Then please run '2_transmission' to calculate the distance from each power plant to corresponding subatation and UHV line.

3. Then please run '3_powercosts' to calculate the cost of each power plant with gradually increasing size.

4. Then please run '4_powercosts_fig1b_onshorewind' and '5_Onshore wind_unitid_lcoe' to make sure location and size of each onshorewind power plants with minimal LCOE.

5. Lastly please run '6_opt_energy_grids_Onshorewind'.
